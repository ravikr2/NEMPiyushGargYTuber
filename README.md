*I was seeing that I watching writing everywhere the same route like
  "./api/users/:id" in (1.)app.get, (2.)app.delete, (3.)app.patch

  for that log writing reason i am using app.route for writing the code short as possible

  like ....>>>>
  app
  .route("./api/users/:id")
  .get((req,res)=>{})
  .delete((req,res)=>{})
  .patch((req,res)=>{})


  # see the next folder for posting, patching and deleting .
  # using of Postman.
